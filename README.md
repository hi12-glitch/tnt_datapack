# TNT Rods Datapack

Adds two special fishing rods:

- **TNT Drill Rod**: fires a TNT drill that repeatedly explodes downward until bedrock.
- **Nuke Rod**: calls in a large orbital-style TNT ring strike at the bobber location.

## Installation

1. Zip this datapack folder (or keep it as an unzipped folder).
2. Put it in your world's datapacks directory:
   - `.../.minecraft/saves/<your_world>/datapacks/`
3. Enter the world and run:
   - `/reload`
4. Get the rods:
   - `/function tnt_rod:items/give_rods`

## Notes

- Designed around modern Java Edition command syntax.
- In multiplayer, targeting uses the **caster's nearest bobber** within 32 blocks.
